### OSI Model

- What it is
  - it is a virtual method of explaining how the Internet works, or the connection between 2 devices through internet
- How many layers it has
  - It has 7 layers
- How it is organized
  1. Physical layer
  2. Data link layer
  3. Network layer
  4. Transport Layer
  5. Session layer
  6. Presentation layer
  7. Application layer

### What is a LAN

- Typical usage
  - it is for sharing data or a printer, gaming or office stuff
- Typical geographical size
  - House, single floor, or a campus

### What is a WAN

- Typical usage
  - Linking and establish a connection between LAN Networks, making the Internet for long distance
- Typical geographical size
  - From cities to unlimited size

### What is the Internet

- What is an IP address
  - Identifier for a computer or a device on a network
- What are the 2 types of IP address
  - Public IP address
  - Private IP address
- What isÂ `localhost`
  - It is hose which is on the local device and has no connection to the internet
- What is a subnet
  - we divide a large network into a smaller one which is more manageable, that we take portion of bits from the host and this portion of bits determines the amount of ips will be available
- Why IPv6 was created
  - Because the IPv4 range is fulfilled and got out of range so we needed to register more ips for newer devices.

### TCP/UDP

- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
  - TCP and UDP
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
  - The TCP establish a connection before transferring data that make the connection more secure and ensure data integrity and errors checking
  - UDP does not establish any prior connection before sending the data that makes it more simpler and faster but not as secure of reliable as the TCP
- What is a port
  - a numeric identifier that distinguish the the data connection for each app and make the connection works
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers'
  - SSH : 22
  - HTTP : 80
  - HTTPS : 443
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
  - ping
