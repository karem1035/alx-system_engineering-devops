### 1. DNS request:

After typing `google.com` on the browser tab and press enter

- The Browser needs to know where is the server of google.com to use it?
- The location of the server it's IP address.
- in order to know the IP Address of google.com the browser sends a DNS Query Request to the DNS resolver server.
- Then the DNS resolver replies with DNS Query response contains the IP address of google (8.8.8.8)
---

### 2. TCP/IP:

- After the browser(client) gets the IP address of the google.com server (e.g., 8.8.8.8), it initiates a TCP/IP Three-Way Handshake
- to ensure that both parties are ready and able to communicate before any data is transmitted.

### 3. Firewall:

- There are 2 Types of Firewalls 1. Client-Side Firewall: Allow or Block traffic or some applications for security measures, most of the time it is a firewall software 2. Server-Side Firewall: The ISP and the Service providers install Hardware firewalls and software firewall too, too filter incoming traffic to protect their customers and their data

### 4. HTTPS/SSL:

- When we see "https" at the beginning of the web address, it means the connection is secure.
- HTTPS uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the communication between your browser and Google's server.
- This encryption protects your data, like passwords or search queries, from being intercepted by anyone else on the network.

### 5. Load Balancer (Possible):

- Large websites like Google often use load balancers.
- These are like traffic directors that distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
- This ensures smooth performance by preventing any single server from getting overloaded.

---

### 6. Web Server:

- The request from your browser reaches a web server on Google's side.
- The web server understands HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the language of the web.
- It interprets your request (to access google.com) and retrieves the necessary files for the webpage.

---

### 7. Application Server:

- In some cases, the web server might hand off the request to an application server.
- This application server might handle dynamic content, like personalized search results or news feeds tailored to you.

---

### 8. Database:

- Depending on what you're trying to access on Google, the application server might need to fetch data from a database.
- This database stores information like website content, user accounts, or search results.
